# Metrics and Dashboards

Kafscale exposes Prometheus metrics on `/metrics` from both brokers and the operator.
The console UI and Grafana dashboard templates are built on the same metrics.

## Endpoints

- **Broker metrics** – `http://<broker-host>:9093/metrics`
- **Operator metrics** – `http://<operator-host>:8080/metrics`

In local development, the console can scrape broker metrics if you set
`KAFSCALE_CONSOLE_BROKER_METRICS_URL`.

## ISR Terminology

The broker advertises ISR (in-sync replica) values as part of metadata responses
and exposes related counts in metrics/UI. This reflects Kafscale's **logical**
replica set in etcd metadata, not Kafka's internal `LeaderAndIsr` protocol. We
do not implement Kafka ISR management or any internal replication APIs; ISR here
is a metadata indicator used for client compatibility and visibility.

## Broker Metrics

Broker metrics are emitted directly by the broker process.

| Metric | Type | Labels | Description |
|--------|------|--------|-------------|
| `kafscale_s3_health_state` | Gauge | `state` | 1 for the active S3 health state (`healthy`, `degraded`, `unavailable`). |
| `kafscale_s3_latency_ms_avg` | Gauge | - | Average S3 latency (ms) over the sliding window. |
| `kafscale_s3_error_rate` | Gauge | - | Fraction of failed S3 operations in the sliding window. |
| `kafscale_s3_state_duration_seconds` | Gauge | - | Seconds spent in the current S3 health state. |
| `kafscale_produce_rps` | Gauge | - | Produce requests per second (sliding window). |
| `kafscale_fetch_rps` | Gauge | - | Fetch requests per second (sliding window). |
| `kafscale_admin_requests_total` | Counter | `api` | Count of admin API requests by API name. |
| `kafscale_admin_request_errors_total` | Counter | `api` | Count of admin API errors by API name. |
| `kafscale_admin_request_latency_ms_avg` | Gauge | `api` | Average admin API latency (ms). |

Admin API label values are human-readable for common ops APIs
(`DescribeGroups`, `ListGroups`, `OffsetForLeaderEpoch`, `DescribeConfigs`,
`AlterConfigs`). Less common keys show as `api_<id>` (for example,
`api_37` for CreatePartitions).

## Operator Metrics

Operator metrics are exported by the controller runtime metrics server.

| Metric | Type | Labels | Description |
|--------|------|--------|-------------|
| `kafscale_operator_clusters` | Gauge | - | Count of managed `KafscaleCluster` resources. |
| `kafscale_operator_snapshot_publish_total` | Counter | `result` | Snapshot publish attempts (`success` or `error`). |
| `kafscale_operator_etcd_snapshot_age_seconds` | Gauge | `cluster` | Seconds since last successful etcd snapshot upload. |
| `kafscale_operator_etcd_snapshot_last_success_timestamp` | Gauge | `cluster` | Unix timestamp of last successful snapshot upload. |
| `kafscale_operator_etcd_snapshot_last_schedule_timestamp` | Gauge | `cluster` | Unix timestamp of last scheduled snapshot job. |
| `kafscale_operator_etcd_snapshot_stale` | Gauge | `cluster` | 1 when the snapshot age exceeds the staleness threshold. |
| `kafscale_operator_etcd_snapshot_success` | Gauge | `cluster` | 1 if at least one successful snapshot was recorded. |
| `kafscale_operator_etcd_snapshot_access_ok` | Gauge | `cluster` | 1 if the snapshot bucket preflight succeeds. |

The `cluster` label uses `namespace/name`.

## Grafana Dashboard

The Grafana template lives in `docs/grafana/broker-dashboard.json`. It expects
Prometheus to scrape both broker and operator metrics endpoints.

## Metric Coverage

Metric names and behavior evolve as the platform grows. When in doubt, consult
the `/metrics` endpoint in your environment to see the current exported series.
